# The algorithmic state machine (ASM) 
The algorithmic state machine (ASM) method is a method for designing finite state machines (FSMs). An ASM diagram comprises of an interconnection of three kinds of fundamental components: state name, state box, and condition checks. An ASM state, addressed as a square shape, relates to one condition of a standard state graph or finite state machine (FSM).

## Decimators 
Decimators are utilized in computerized signal processors to move information from a high-clock-rate datapath to a lower-clock-rate datapath. They are likewise used to change over information from a parallel arrangement to a sequential configuration 
The most quick motivation to annihilate is just to reduce the inspecting rate at the yield of one system so a framework working at a lower testing rate can enter the sign.
